# Plagiarism Detector

### **Project Description**  
Plagiarism Detector is a C++ application designed to help users identify potential plagiarism between two text documents. It uses text preprocessing and similarity measures like Jaccard Similarity and Cosine Similarity to evaluate the degree of overlap between the documents. This tool is suitable to ensure originality in their work.
